**Task Management App with Express.js and MongoDB**
This repository contains the source code for a simple Task Management application built with Express.js and MongoDB.
The application provides a RESTful API for managing tasks, including functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks
The data is stored in a MongoDB database, and the application uses Express Validator for input validation.

**Features**
**Create Task**: Add new tasks with a title, description, and status (pending, inProgress, completed).
**Read Tasks**: Retrieve a list of all tasks or get details about a specific task by ID.
**Update Task**: Modify existing tasks, including the title, description, and status.
**Delete Task**: Remove tasks from the database.
**Validation**
The application employs Express Validator to validate incoming data, ensuring that task creation and updates adhere to specified criteria. This includes checking for required fields, length constraints, uniqueness of task titles, and valid MongoDB IDs.

**Technologies Used**
**Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
**MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing task data.
**Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
**Express Validator**: Middleware for Express.js that provides validation of request data.
**Installation and Usage**
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Configure the MongoDB connection URI in the connect function.
Run the application using node your-file-name.js.
Test the API using tools like Postman or curl.
